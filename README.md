# Simple-HTTP-Server
This repository contains a Python-based HTTP server implementation that serves files over TCP/IP using the HTTP protocol. The server listens on port 6789 and responds to HTTP GET requests by serving the requested file if it exists. It handles basic HTTP status codes (200 OK and 404 Not Found) and provides appropriate responses. This implementation is suitable for educational purposes or as a simple file server for small-scale applications.
